            <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a
                paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In
                reality,though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A
                paragraph isdefined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and
                Connors 116).</p><br>
